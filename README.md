# Reddit Marketing
## This is a idea around how you can market in reddit

Let me start off by saying this : *marketing on __reddit__ is a risky game*, and if you do what the dumb 99% of people do, you'll not only fail as a
marketer, but you'll also be banned from reddit. Marketing on reddit sends chills down even the most experienced marketer's spine.

But here's the catch, after google and facebook, reddit is the  third most visited site in UK and USA. So if the fish is this big, you want to
jump in even if there's a chance of your legs bitten off! It means that reddit can no longer be a channel we avoid, we cannot ignore reddit
anymore, we've to get those conversions from reddit or die trying!

Toady I'm going to discuss how we can not only get to spread the word and market our technology/app, but also stay alive in the process - i.e.
how not to get banned/cancelled on reddit while marketing to redditers

There's some confusion around reddit that I first want to address before moving on with the topic - reddit is like any other social network.
People come there to see, read and talk about something they love. Reddit is filled with millions of subreddits which are like mini forums, where
people talk about what they like, their interest and other kind of things. If the content is really good in these subreddits, content which is 
generating a lot of traction gets upvoted on reddit by the users. So what people really want is content which is good, content which is worth
upvoting, content which has value to it and reading it through in 3 to 4 minutes is adding value to their life.

As marketers, out primary focus should be to find out about which kind of subreddit does our content fit into - crytpo, blockchain, 
smartcontracts, health and lifestyles are some of them. Then we have to find out which kind of posts are performing overwhelmingly well in those
subreddits, and figure out the anatomy of that post - why is it gaining the traction, why are people upvoting it, what is their view on the post
that they might have written in comments, etc. Then we should try and build even better content on top of that keeping in mind all the necessary 
information that the famous post had in itsef. We need to figure out what kind of content the people in the subreddit are interested in and 
ensuring that the content you're delivering back to them fits the criteria.

This is what I want you people to do - go into a subreddit, and sort the content by top posts, then look at the top 30 posts and what do they all
have - the type of content they have, the type of images they have, what is the subject the post is talking about and more importantly, how is 
the post talking about its subject. Then collect all that data in a spreadsheet. That is the subreddits' winning content, that is what we need
to make, just 100x better. That is what our audience really want and will share it.

The next thing I want to emphasize is the fact that reddit has a community element to it. Reddit is not a place where you just upload videos,
pictures, articles and call it a day; praying that someone will upvote your post. No, reddit doesn't works like that. You've to take every
opportunity you get to add more value to the people in the subreddit and that's the only way you're reaching the top of that subreddit. If 
someone asks a question about something related to our industry, go out there and write an answer so explanatory and so simple to understand
that people love what you're saying, they'll give you good karma and follow you. Use that question, that opportunity to jump into the dialogue,
jump into the conversation and add value to the post, add so much value that the entire thread becomes about you, become about the value answer
you've shared.

### Now I'll discuss some etiquettes of reddit, what you should and shouldn't do as a redditer.
* __first and foremost:__ don't keep posting too much, people of reddit can sniff marketing from miles away and if you're posting something which is
not adding value, not helping people, is not telling a story, people will report you and you'll be banned from the subreddit! Make sure you're commenting on other people's post and actively engaging as a community to add value and build trust. If you show up spamming links, no one is going to like it and the chances of success will be a mere zero percent.

* __second:__ Don't go on posting the same comment in different reddit pages, reddit have a great mechanism for sniffing out spammer and if you do something like that, chances are that reddit will limit your access in the subreddit and can also get you __BANNED__ which we __DO NOT WANT__ under any cost.

* __third piece of advice:__ _Ignorance is no excuse_. Every subreddit has it's rule listed, after you join one make sure to go through the rules and try not to break them, it may cause your account to be banned from that subreddit, which again, is a very bad thing to happen.

### Let's start off our reddit journey with this as of now. Try to maintain only one account as even a single account is hectic enough! Follow what is being said in this repo and inculcate something of your own if you think that's a good idea.
